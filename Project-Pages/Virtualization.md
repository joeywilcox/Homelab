# Virtualization

## Overview
This documents my journey through implementing my own Proxmox server! While I already knew about virtualization and hypervisors, this was my first experience implementing virtual machines on a hypervisor.

## Project Completion Date 🏁
**June 2023**

## Process
1. I formatted a USB drive with the Proxmox image and prepared the server for installation.
2. Walked through the installation steps and got a successful install message, yay! 🎉
3. Connected to the network and discovered the server was refusing to connect to the network 🙃
4. Went through the re-installation more carefully and ensured the network settings (IP Address & Subnet) were correctly defined for my network.
5. Again, connected to the network and was able to successfully connect!
6. Off to building virtual machines! 🎉
